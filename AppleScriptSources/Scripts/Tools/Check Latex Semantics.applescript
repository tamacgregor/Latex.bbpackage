	(*	ChkTeX can be told to use a custom format with the option -f followed by a string of these:

		%b String to print between fields (from -s option).
		%c Column position of error.
		%d Length of error (digit).
		%f Current file name.
		%i Turn on inverse printing mode.
		%I Turn off inverse printing mode.
		%k kind of error (warning, error, message).
		%l line number of error.
		%m Warning message.
		%n Warning number.
		%u An underlining line (like the one which appears when using “-v1”).
		%r Part of line in front of error (‘S’ - 1).
		%s Part of line which contains error (string).
		%t Part of line after error (‘S’ + 1).
